This is beta software. For now, we only provide installation instructions
for Unix:

   1. Build the library (see below)
   2. type "make install" (make uninstall provided too)

the library name is "libfreetype.so" (FreeType 1.x uses "libttf.so")

In order to build the library, read the "BUILD" document in the "docs"
directory. Quick starter: go to "freetype2-beta8", then:


  Unix (+GNU Make):
     
     - make
     - make


  Windows + gcc + GNU Make:     
     
     - make
