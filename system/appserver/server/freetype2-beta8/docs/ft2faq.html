<a name="general-dead">
<h3>I.1. I though the FreeType project was dead. Is this true?</h3>
<ul>
  <p>Well, not exactly :-) It's true that the TrueType patents issues
     have been less than a graceful event to handle but it didn't not
     really killed the project per se, as Apple hasn't made an official
     statement yet regarding the use of the patented "technology" in
     open source projects (or other products).</p>

  <p>We have thus continued updating FreeType 1.x, and started developping
     FreeType 2 with the idea of providing this time a completely patent
     free font engine. However, we largely preferred not to broadly
     communicate about it until we've got a satisfying implementation
     to show.</p>
</ul>


<a name="general-long">
<h3>I.2. Why did it take so long to release FreeType 2?</h3>
<ul>
  <p>Several factors come to mind. The first one is that FreeType 2 is
     a much more complex and dense project that was mostly developed
     on non-working hours. And surely some important changes in the
     life (like marriage, new jobs and kids) of some the FreeType
     developers cannot be ignored :-)</p>

  <p>A second one is that a first version of the library was designed
     one year ago (and already worked with a multitude of font drivers),
     though with a design that was judged by its authors as well as
     beta testers as not enough flexible or consistent. In short, it worked
     well but we were not exactly proud of it (call us perfectionists).
     It has then be significantly reworked to become what we're now
     distributing as FreeType 2</p>

  <p>Finally, it would have been hard to distribute such a library without
     an alternative technology to replace the patented bytecode interpreter.
     This involved significant research work that could only be performed
     correctly full-time, and we had to found a company to fund such a
     development and still make it available under a BSD-like license.
     Huge thanks to <a href="http://www.catharon.com">Catharon Productions, Inc.</a>
     for their commitment to this project.</p>

  <p>And of course, we added support for more font files, and we'll
     continue to as long as the specs are available and that we find an
     interest in it. For example,  FreeType 2 is to date the only
     software library available on the market that supports the new
     Adobe "CEF" font format.</p>
</ul>

<a name="general-unix">
<h3>I.3. Is FreeType 2 a Unix-only project?</h3>
<ul>
  <p>Absolutely not, even though many people still seem to think so :-)
     FreeType 2, just like version 1.x, can be compiled on any platform with
     an ANSI compiler. Some beta versions of the library are even heavily
     used in brand new OSes (see the <a href="http://www.atheos.cx">AtheOS
     </a> screenshots for examples).</p>

  <p>The library is itself mainly developped on several platforms
     (Windows & Linux, though a great deal has also been achieved on OS/2)
     and the code is highly generic and modular to adapt even the most
     strict environments like low-memory embedded systems.</p>

</ul>

<a name="general-x11">
<h3>I.4. When will X11/XFree support anti-aliased text?</h3>
<ul>
  <p>This question isn't exactly related to FreeType as we have no direct
     connection to the XFree people, but we've been asked so frequently
     about it that it deserves a prominent place in this FAQ :-)</p>

  <p>FreeType has been capable of anti-aliasing since version 1.0. The
     reason why XFree doesn't support it is directly related to the
     limitations of the design and specification of X11. More specifically:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>
       X11 assumes that all glyph images are monochrome bitmaps,
       hence the X font library and server are unable to send anything
       else to the X server.
    </p></li>

    <li><p>
       Even if the X font library/server was able to generate anti-aliased
       bitmaps (and this has been already done through extensions), the X
       rendering model doesn't allow translucent composition of "gray" pixmaps
       onto an arbitrary drawable.
    </p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>As both the font and rendering models of X11 are limited, it's basically
     impossible to draw anti-aliased glyphs without performing <em>huge</em>
     hacks within the server.</p>

  <p>Note that Keith Packard, from XFree fame, has recently started working
     on a new rendering model for X11 in order to support new features
     (mainly transparency and anti-aliased fonts). This will be provided
     through protocol extensions. The question of knowing wether legacy X
     applications will be able to display anti-aliased text is still very
     uncertain.
     </p>
</ul>

<a name="general-ft1">
<h3>I.5. Is FreeType 2 backwards compatible with FreeType 1.x?</h3>
<ul>
  <p>Not directly, though we had the project to provide an optional binary
     compatibility layer on top of it in order to easily re-link applications
     with the new version. However, this idea has been dropped as it is
     possible to install and use the two versions independtly on any
     system (read: no namespace conflicts).</p>

  <p>The FreeType 2 API is a lot simpler than the one in 1.x while being
     much more powerful. We thus encourage you to adapt your source code
     to it as this should not involve much work.</p>

</ul>

<a name="general-edit">
<h3>I.6. Can I use FreeType 2 to edit fonts or create new ones?</h3>
<ul>
  <p>The answer is a definitive NO, because the library was specifically
     designed to <em>read</em> font files with small code size and very
     low memory usage.</p>

  <p>We thus do not plan to support editing or creation in the font
     engine in any way, as this would imply a complete rewrite. This
     doesn't mean that we won't introduce a font editing/creation library
     in the future, as this really depends on how many people are asking
     for it (or how much they would be willing to pay for it), as well as
     the time of the FreeType developers.</p>

  <p>Do not expect anything in this direction until we officially announce
     something though. There are other axis of development for this project
     (like text-layout capabilities, glyph caching, etc..) that may be more
     important to us at the moment..</p>

<h2 align=center><a name="builds">Compilation & Configuration</h2>
</td></tr><tr><td>

<a name="builds-compile">
<h3>II.1. How do I compile the FreeType 2 library?</h3>
<ul>
  <p>The library can be compiled in various ways, and a detailed documentation
     is available in the file "<tt>freetype2/docs/BUILD</tt>". However, we'll
     summarize the process to a few cases:</p>

  <h3>a. by using the command-line 2 build system</h3>

  <p>The engine comes with a sophisticated build system that is used
     to configure and compile a build of the library. You'll need
     <em>GNU Make</em> installed on your platform (NOTE: It will <b>not</b>
     work with other Make tools).</p>

  <p>Basically, you'll need to invoke <tt>make</tt> a first time in the
     top-level FreeType 2 directory in order to setup the build. This will
     detect your current platform and choose a configuration sub-makefile to
     drive the build. A specific compiler can be selected on some platforms
     by providing an additional target. For example, on Win32:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b><tt>make visualc</tt></b> will select the Visual C++ compiler</li>
    <li><b><tt>make lcc</tt></b> will select the Win32-lcc compiler</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that on Unix, the first time make is called, a configure script
     located in "<tt>freetype2/builds/unix</tt>" will be run in order to
     automatically detect the platform & compiler.</p>

  <p>A summary will be displayed showing the detected platform and compiler
     selected. You'll then be able to start the build by invoking <tt>make</tt>
     a second time. In case of problem, consult the <tt>BUILD</tt> document.</p>


  <h3>b. by direct compilation</h3>

  <p>You can also directly compile the library from the command line by
     using these simple rules:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>
       You should place the directories "<tt>freetype2/include</tt>" and
       "<tt>freetype2/src</tt>" in your include path in order to compile
       any component of the library. You can also add the system-specific
       build directory (i.e. "<tt>builds/<em>system</em>/</tt>") in the
       case where an alternate implementation of some of the components
       is available there (e.g. the memory-mapped i/o implementation
       on some Unix systems).
    </p></li>

    <li><p>
       The components of the library are located in sub-directories of
       "<tt>src</tt>", for example: "<tt>src/base</tt>",
       "<tt>src/truetype</tt>", etc..
    </p></li>

    <li><p>
       Each component is normally compiled through a single C file that
       "wraps" other sources in the component's directory. For example,
       your should compile the TrueType font driver by compiling the
       file "<tt>src/truetype/truetype.c</tt>". The list of C files to
       compile for a feature-complete build of the library is given in
       the <tt>BUILD</tt> document.
    </p></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>c. in a graphical IDE</h3>
  <ul>
    <p>Well, the process is vastly similar to the one described in b.,
       except that you need to set the include paths, source code paths,
       etc.. in dialog boxes before running the compilation.
    </p>
  </ul>

</ul>

<a name="builds-config">
<h3>II.2. How do I configure my build of the library?</h3>
<ul>
  <p>Each build of the library is configured through two header files
     located in "<tt>include/freetype/config</tt>":</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p><b><tt>ftoption.h</tt></b><br>
        This file contains various configuration macros whose definition
	can be toggled on a per-build basis. Each macro is heavily
	commented in this file's comment, and we invite you to refer
	to it directly.</p></li>

    <li><p><b><tt>ftmodule.h</tt></b><br>
        This file contains the list of all the modules that are initially
	registered (added) when the function <b><tt>FT_Init_FreeType</tt></b>
	is called. See the next answer to know how to change it and
	why it may be important.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Alternatively, some specific implementations of some FT2 components
     can be provided in a "<tt>builds/<em>system</em>/</tt>" directory
     (e.g. the Unix-specific <tt>ftsystem.c</tt> that uses memory-mapped
     file for i/o).</p>
</ul>

<a name="builds-modules">
<h3>II.3. How do I select the modules I need in my build?</h3>
<ul>
  <p>The function <tt><b>FT_Init_FreeType</b></tt> creates a new instance
     of the FT2 library and registers a set of "default" modules before
     returning to the calling application. Its default implementation
     is in the file "<tt>src/base/ftinit.c</tt>".</p>

  <p>The list of default modules used by <tt>ftinit.c</tt> is located in
     the configuration file "<tt>include/freetype/config/ftmodule.h</tt>".
     It is normally automatically generated by the build system by
     invoking the "<tt><b>make modules</b></tt>" command in the top
     level FT2 directory (note: only works with GNU Make, you can
     edit the file by hand otherwise). It does so by parsing all
     sub-directories of "<tt>src</tt>" that contain a file named
     <tt>module.mk</tt>.</p>

  <p>Note that a specific port or project is free to provide its own
     implementation of <tt>ftinit.c</tt> in order to ensure a different
     initialisation sequence. For example, one could do something like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>compile each module as a shared library (DLL or .so) with
           a common "entry point" to retrieve a pointer to its
	   module class (there is already some code that allows this
	   when compiling each module).</p></li>

    <li><p>place these modules in a directory like
          "<tt>/usr/lib/freetype2/modules/</tt>"</p></li>

    <li><p>provide an implementation of <tt>ftinit.c</tt> that would
           scan the directory for valid modules.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>This example only emphasize the flexibility that is left to
     developers when building the library.</p>

</ul>

<a name="builds-flat">
<h3>II.4. How do I compile all FreeType 2 files in a single directory?</h3>
<ul>
  <p>Some projects may need, for the sake of simplicity or ease of
     building, to compile the FT2 library with all source files
     copied to a single directory. This is possible.</p>

  <p>To do so, you'll need to copy all source files located under
     "<tt>src</tt>" to your own directory (you must retain the
     include files in a distinct hierarchy though), then compile
     each of the FreeType 2 component with the macro
     <tt><b>FT_FLAT_COMPILE</b></tt>. This will change the way
     <tt><b>#include</b></tt> works during the build.</p>

<a name="autohint-license">
<h3>IV.1. Under which license is the FreeType 2 auto-hinter released</h3>
<ul>
  <p>The auto-hinter was initially designed and implemented under contract
     for <a href="http://www.catharon.com">Catharon Productions, Inc</a>
     which gladly accepted to released it under an open-source license
     compatible with the FreeType one.</p>

  <p>This license can be found in "<tt>src/autohint/CatharonLicense.txt</tt>"
     and requires that you cite Catharon Productions in your documentation
     (just like you do with FreeType) when using the auto-hinting module.</p>

  <p>Other than that, you still have the same freedom than with the good old
     FreeType license. Enjoy !</p>
</ul>

<a name="autohint-work">
<h3>IV.2. How does the auto-hinter works ?</h3>
<ul>
  <p>Well, a complete description would be difficult. Have a look at the
     dedicated <a href="autohinting/index.html">auto-hinter pages</a> on the FreeType
     site, as they describe most of its details with graphics and explanations.
     You could also look at the source code if you want to :-)</p>

  <p>To give a few details, the auto-hinter is used to perform grid-fitting
     on scalable font formats that use bezier outlines as their primary glyph
     image format (this means nearly all scalable font formats today). When
     a given font driver doesn't provide its own hinter, the auto-hinter is
     used by default. When a format-specific hinter is provided, it is still
     possible to use the auto-hinter using the
     <tt><b>FT_LOAD_FORCE_AUTOHINT</b></tt> bit flag when calling
     <tt>FT_Load_Glyph</tt>.</p>

  <p>The auto-hinter currently doesn't use external hints to do its job,
     as it automatically computes global metrics (when it "opens" a font
     for the first time) and glyph "hints" from their outline. Note that
     we plan the ability to specify external hints, given that it is based
     on a constraint system. That could be used to support native hints
     in Type 1/Type 2 fonts, for example.</p>
</ul>

<a name="autohint-cjk">
<h3>IV.3. Why does the auto-hinter doesn't work correctly with CJK fonts ?</h3>
<ul>
  <p>The auto-hinter was first designed to manage and hint latin-based fonts,
     as they consist of most of the fonts available today. It doesn't hint
     asian fonts, as well as a few other complex scripts, because we didn't
     put enough research on the topic yet. Hinting CJK isn't really more
     difficult than latin, just different with a set of different constraints
     (basically, more distortion of glyphs is acceptable as long as certain
     features like triple-stem positions are respected more strictly..).</p>

  <p>We thus plan to handle such a case rather rapidly.. Please be patient.</p>
</ul>

<h2 align=center><a name="other">Other questions</h2>
</td></tr><tr><td>

<a name="other-antialias">
<h3>V.1. What is the anti-aliasing algorithm used by FreeType 2 ?</h3>
<ul>
  <p>The algorithm has been specifically designed for FreeType. It is
     based on ideas that were originally found in the implementation
     of the <a href="http://www.levien.com/libart">libArt</a> graphics
     library to compute the <em>exact pixel coverage</em> of a vector
     image with absolutely now sub-sampling/filtering.
     </p>

  <p>However, these two implementations are radically distinct and use
     vastly different models. The FreeType 2 renderer is optimized
     specifically for rendering small complex shapes, like glyphs, at
     very high speed while using very few memory; while libArt shines
     at general shape/polygon processing, especially large ones.</p>

  <p>The FT2 anti-aliasing renderer is indeed <em>faster</em> than the
     monochrome renderer for small character sizes (typically &lt; 20 pixels).
     This is explained because the monochrome renderer must perform two
     passes on the outline in order to perform drop-out control according
     to the TrueType spec (we could drop this requirement later though).</p>

  <p>We'll try to document its design in a later document, though this is
     not a priority for now.</p>
</ul>

<a name="other-opentype">
<h3>V.2. When will FreeType 2 support OpenType ?</h3>
<ul>
  <p>Well, the engine already reads OpenType/CFF files perfectly. What it
     doesn't do is handle "OpenType Layout" tables yet.</p>
     
  <p>FreeType 1 comes with a set of extensions that are used to load
     and manage OpenType Layout tables. It even has a demonstration program
     named "<tt>ftstrtto</tt>" used to demonstrate its capabilities that
     runs pretty smooth.</p>
     
  <p>For FreeType 2, we have decided that the layout operations provided
     through these tables is better placed in a specific text-layout library,
     (many people having asked for such a thing). This new engine would not
     depend on FT2 explicitely and will be developed as a separate project.
     We plan to announce it in a few weeks with all gory details,
     once the definitive 2.0 release of FreeType has been made.</p>
