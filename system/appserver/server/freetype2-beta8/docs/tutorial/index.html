  <h2>
    Introduction
  </h2>

  <p>This short tutorial will teach you how to use the FreeType&nbsp;2
  library in your own applications.</p>

  <hr>

    <h3>
      1. Header files
    </h3>

    <p>To include the main FreeType header file, simply say</p>

    <font color="blue">
    <pre>
    #include &lt;freetype/freetype.h&gt;</pre>
    </font>

    <p>in your application code.  Note that other files are available in the
    FreeType include directory, most of them being included by
    <tt>"freetype.h"</tt>.  They will be described later in this
    tutorial.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>
      2. Initialize the library
    </h3>

    <p>Simply create a variable of type <tt>FT_Library</tt> named, for
    example, <tt>library</tt>, and call the function
    <tt>FT_Init_FreeType()</tt> as in</p>

    <font color="blue">
    <pre>
    #include &lt;freetype/freetype.h&gt;

    FT_Library  library;

    ...

    {
      ...
      error = FT_Init_FreeType( &library );
      if ( error )
      {
        ... an error occurred during library initialization ...
      }
    }</pre>
    </font>

    <p>This function is in charge of the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
         <p>Creating a new instance of the FreeType&nbsp;2 library, and set
         the handle <tt>library</tt> to it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Load each modules that FreeType knows about in the library. 
        This means that by default, your new <tt>library</tt> object is able
        to handle TrueType, Type&nbsp;1, CID-keyed & OpenType/CFF fonts
        gracefully.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>As you can see, the function returns an error code, like most others
    in the FreeType API.  An error code of&nbsp;0 <em>always</em> means that
    the operation was successful; otherwise, the value describes the error,
    and <tt>library</tt> is set to NULL.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>
      3. Load a font face
    </h3>

      <h4>
        a. From a font file
      </h4>

      <p>Create a new <em>face</em> object by calling <tt>FT_New_Face</tt>. 
      A <em>face</em> describes a given typeface and style.  For example,
      "Times New Roman Regular" and "Times New Roman Italic" correspond to
      two different faces.</p>

      <font color="blue">
      <pre>
    FT_Library   library;   /* handle to library     */
    FT_Face      face;      /* handle to face object */

    error = FT_Init_FreeType( &library );
    if ( error ) { ... }

    error = FT_New_Face( library,
                         "/usr/share/fonts/truetype/arial.ttf",
                         0,
                         &face );
    if ( error == FT_Err_Unknown_File_Format )
    {
      ... the font file could be opened and read, but it appears
      ... that its font format is unsupported
    }
    else if ( error )
    {
      ... another error code means that the font file could not
      ... be opened or read, or simply that it is broken...
    }</pre>
      </font>

      <p>As you can certainly imagine, <tt>FT_New_Face</tt> opens a font
      file, then tries to extract one face from it.  Its parameters are</p>

      <table cellpadding=5>
        <tr valign="top">
          <td>
            <tt><b>library</b></tt>
          </td>
          <td>
            <p>handle to the FreeType library instance where the face object
            is created</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr valign="top">
          <td>
            <tt><b>filepathname</b></tt>
          </td>
          <td>
            <p>the font file pathname (standard C string).</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr valign="top">
          <td>
            <tt><b>face_index</b></tt>
          </td>
          <td>
            <p>Certain font formats allow several font faces to be embedded
            in a single file.</p>

            <p>This index tells which face you want to load.  An error will
            be returned if its value is too large.</p>

            <p>Index 0 always work though.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr valign="top">
          <td>
            <tt><b>face</b></tt>
          </td>
          <td>
            <p>A <em>pointer</em> to the handle that will be set to describe
            the new face object.</p>

            <p>It is set to NULL in case of error.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>To know how many faces a given font file contains, simply load its
      first face (use <tt>face_index</tt>=0), then see the value of
      <tt>face->num_faces</tt> which indicates how many faces are embedded
      in the font file.</p>

      <h4>
        b. From memory
      </h4>

      <p>In the case where you have already loaded the font file in memory,
      you can similarly create a new face object for it by calling
      <tt>FT_New_Memory_Face</tt> as in</p>

      <font color="blue">
      <pre>
    FT_Library   library;   /* handle to library     */
    FT_Face      face;      /* handle to face object */

    error = FT_Init_FreeType( &library );
    if ( error ) { ... }

    error = FT_New_Memory_Face( library,
                                buffer,    /* first byte in memory */
                                size,      /* size in bytes        */
                                0,         /* face_index           */
                                &face );
    if ( error ) { ... }</pre>
      </font>

      <p>As you can see, <tt>FT_New_Memory_Face()</tt> simply takes a
      pointer to the font file buffer and its size in bytes instead of a
      file pathname.  Other than that, it has exactly the same semantics as
      <tt>FT_New_Face()</tt>.</p>

      <h4>
        c. From other sources (compressed files, network, etc.)
      </h4>

      <p>There are cases where using a file pathname or preloading the file
      in memory is simply not enough.  With FreeType&nbsp;2, it is possible
      to provide your own implementation of i/o routines.</p>

      <p>This is done through the <tt>FT_Open_Face()</tt> function, which
      can be used to open a new font face with a custom input stream, select
      a specific driver for opening, or even pass extra parameters to the
      font driver when creating the object.  We advise you to refer to the
      FreeType&nbsp;2 reference manual in order to learn how to use it.</p>

      <p>Note that providing a custom stream might also be used to access a
      TrueType font embedded in a Postscript Type&nbsp;42 wrapper.</p>

    <h3>
      4. Accessing face content
    </h3>

    <p>A <em>face object</em> models all information that globally describes
    the face.  Usually, this data can be accessed directly by dereferencing
    a handle, like</p>

    <table cellpadding=5>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td>
          <tt><b>face->num_glyphs</b></tt>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>Gives the number of <em>glyphs</em> available in the font face.
          A glyph is simply a character image.  It doesn't necessarily
          correspond to a <em>character code</em> though.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td>
          <tt><b>face->flags</b></tt>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>A 32-bit integer containing bit flags used to describe some
          face properties.  For example, the flag
          <tt>FT_FACE_FLAG_SCALABLE</tt> is used to indicate that the face's
          font format is scalable and that glyph images can be rendered for
          all character pixel sizes.  For more information on face flags,
          please read the <a href="#">FreeType&nbsp;2 API Reference</a>.</p>

        <td>
          <p>This field is only valid for scalable formats (it is set to 0

          in the current face.  A <em>strike</em> is simply a series of
          glyph images for a given character pixel size.  For example, a
          font face could include strikes for pixel sizes 10, 12
          and&nbsp;14.  Note that even scalable font formats can have
          embedded bitmap strikes!</p>

        <td>
          <p>this is a pointer to an array of <tt>FT_Bitmap_Size</tt>
          elements.  Each <tt>FT_Bitmap_Size</tt> indicates the horizontal

    <h3>
      5. Setting the current pixel size
    </h3>

    <p>FreeType 2 uses "<em>size objects</em>" to model all
       information related to a given character size for a given face.
       For example, a size object will hold the value of certain metrics
       like the ascender or  text height, expressed in 1/64th of a pixel,
       for a character size of 12 points.</p>

    <p>When the <tt>FT_New_Face</tt> function is called (or one of its
       cousins), it <b>automatically</b> creates a new size object for
       the returned face. This size object is directly accessible as
       <b><tt>face->size</tt></b>.</p>
       
    <p><em>NOTA BENE: a single face object can deal with one or more size
       objects at a time, however, this is something that few programmers
       really need to do. We have thus have decided to simplify the API for
       the most common use (i.e. one size per face), while keeping this
       feature available through additional fuctions.</em></p>
    
    <p>When a new face object is created, its size object defaults to the
       character size of 10&nbsp;pixels (both horizontally and vertically) for
       scalable formats.  For fixed-sizes formats, the size is more or less
       undefined, which is why you must set it before trying to load a
       glyph.</p>

    <p>To do that, simply call <tt>FT_Set_Char_Size()</tt>.  Here is an
       example where the character size is set to 16pt for a 300x300&nbsp;dpi
       device:</p>

    <font color="blue">
    <pre>
    error = FT_Set_Char_Size(
              face,    /* handle to face object           */
              0,       /* char_width in 1/64th of points  */
              16*64,   /* char_height in 1/64th of points */
              300,     /* horizontal device resolution    */
              300 );   /* vertical device resolution      */</pre>
    </font>

    <p>You will notice that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The character width and heights are specified in 1/64th of
        points. A point is a <em>physical</em> distance, equaling 1/72th
	of an inch, it's not a pixel..<p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The horizontal and vertical device resolutions are expressed in
        <em>dots-per-inch</em>, or <em>dpi</em>. You can use 72 or
        96&nbsp;dpi for display devices like the screen. The resolution
	is used to compute the character pixel size from the character
	point size.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A value of&nbsp;0 for the character width means "<em>same as
        character height</em>", a value of&nbsp;0 for the character height
        means "<em>same as character width</em>".  Otherwise, it is possible
        to specify different char widths and heights.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Using a value of 0 for the horizontal or vertical resolution means
        72&nbsp;dpi, which is the default.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The first argument is a handle to a face object, not a size
	   object. That's normal, and must be seen as a convenience.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>This function computes the character pixel size that corresponds to
    the character width and height and device resolutions.  However, if you
    want to specify the pixel sizes yourself, you can simply call
    <tt>FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes()</tt>, as in</p>

    <font color="blue">
    <pre>
    error = FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes(
              face,   /* handle to face object            */
              0,      /* pixel_width                      */
              16 );   /* pixel_height                     */</pre>
    </font>

    <p>This example will set the character pixel sizes to 16x16&nbsp;pixels. 
    As previously, a value of&nbsp;0 for one of the dimensions means
    "<em>same as the other</em>".</p>

    <p>Note that both functions return an error code.  Usually, an error
    occurs with a fixed-size font format (like FNT or PCF) when trying to
    set the pixel size to a value that is not listed in the
    <tt><b>face->fixed_sizes</b></tt> array.</p>

    <h3>
      6. Loading a glyph image
    </h3>

      <h4>
        a. Converting a character code into a glyph index
      </h4>

      <p>Usually, an application wants to load a glyph image based on its
      <em>character code</em>, which is a unique value that defines the
      character for a given <em>encoding</em>.  For example, the character
      code&nbsp;65 represents the `A' in ASCII encoding.</p>

      <p>A face object contains one or more tables, called
      <em>charmaps</em>, that are used to convert character codes to glyph
      indices.  For example, most TrueType fonts contain two charmaps.  One
      is used to convert Unicode character codes to glyph indices, the other
      is used to convert Apple Roman encoding into glyph indices.  Such
      fonts can then be used either on Windows (which uses Unicode) and
      Macintosh (which uses Apple Roman, bwerk).  Note also that a given
      charmap might not map to all the glyphs present in the font.</p>

      <p>By default, when a new face object is created, it lists all the
      charmaps contained in the font face and selects the one that supports
      Unicode character codes if it finds one.  Otherwise, it tries to find
      support for Latin-1, then ASCII.</p>

      <p>We will describe later how to look for specific charmaps in a face. 
      For now, we will assume that the face contains at least a Unicode
      charmap that was selected during <tt>FT_New_Face()</tt>.  To convert a
      Unicode character code to a font glyph index, we use
      <tt>FT_Get_Char_Index()</tt> as in</p>

      <font color="blue">
      <pre>
    glyph_index = FT_Get_Char_Index( face, charcode );</pre>
      </font>

      <p>This will look the glyph index corresponding to the given
      <tt>charcode</tt> in the charmap that is currently selected for the
      face.  If charmap is selected, the function simply returns the
      charcode.</p>

      <p>Note that this is one of the rare FreeType functions that do not
      return an error code.  However, when a given character code has no
      glyph image in the face, the value&nbsp;0 is returned.  By convention,
      it always correspond to a special glyph image called the <b>missing
      glyph</b>, which usually is represented as a box or a space.</p>

      <h4>
        b. Loading a glyph from the face
      </h4>

      <p>Once you have a glyph index, you can load the corresponding glyph
      image.  Note that the glyph image can be in several formats.  For
      example, it will be a bitmap for fixed-size formats like FNT, FON, or
      PCF.  It will also be a scalable vector outline for formats like
      TrueType or Type&nbsp;1.  The glyph image can also be stored in an
      alternate way that is not known at the time of writing this
      documentation.</p>

      <p>The glyph image is always stored in a special object called a
      <em>glyph slot</em>.  As its name suggests, a glyph slot is simply a
      container that is able to hold one glyph image at a time, be it a
      bitmap, an outline, or something else.  Each face object has a single
      glyph slot object that can be accessed as
      <b><tt>face->glyph</tt></b>.</p>

      <p>Loading a glyph image into the slot is performed by calling
      <tt>FT_Load_Glyph()</tt> as in</p>

      <font color="blue">
      <pre>
    error = FT_Load_Glyph( 
              face,          /* handle to face object */
              glyph_index,   /* glyph index           */
              load_flags );  /* load flags, see below */</pre>
      </font>

      <p>The <tt>load_flags</tt> value is a set of bit flags used to
      indicate some special operations.  The default value
      <tt>FT_LOAD_DEFAULT</tt> is&nbsp;0.</p>
      
      <p>This function will try to load the corresponding glyph image
         from the face. Basically, this means that:</p>
	 
      <ul>
        <li>
	  <p>If a bitmap is found for the corresponding glyph and pixel
	     size, it will in the slot (embedded bitmaps are always
	     favored over native image formats, because we assume that
	     they are higher-quality versions of the same image. This
	     can be ignored by using the FT_LOAD_NO_BITMAP flag)</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	  <p>Otherwise, a native image for the glyph will be loaded.
	     It will also be scaled to the current pixel size, as
	     well as hinted for certain formats like TrueType and
	     Type1.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The field <tt><b>glyph->format</b></tt> describe the format
         used to store the glyph image in the slot. If it is not
	 <tt>ft_glyph_format_bitmap</tt>, one can immediately
	 convert it to a bitmap through <tt>FT_Render_Glyph</tt>,
	 as in:</p>

      <font color="blue">
      <pre>
   error = FT_Render_Glyph(
                  face->glyph,      /* glyph slot  */
		  render_mode );    /* render mode */
      </pre>
      </font>
	 
      <p>The parameter <tt>render_mode</tt> is a set of bit flags used
         to specify how to render the glyph image. Set it to 0 to render
	 a monochrome bitmap, or to <tt>ft_render_mode_antialias</tt> to
	 generate a high-quality (256 gray levels) anti-aliased bitmap
	 from the glyph image.</p>

      <p>Once you have a bitmap glyph image, you can access it directly
         through <tt><b>glyph->bitmap</b></tt> (a simple bitmap descriptor),
	 and position it through <tt><b>glyph->bitmap_left</b></tt> and
	 <tt><b>glyph->bitmap_top</b></tt>.</p>
	 
      <p>Note that <tt>bitmap_left</tt> is the horizontal distance from the
         current pen position to the left-most border of the glyph bitmap,
	 while <tt>bitmap_top</tt> is the vertical distance from the
	 pen position (on the baseline) to the top-most border of the
	 glyph bitmap. <em>It is positive to indicate an upwards
	 distance</em>.</p>

      <p>The next section will detail the content of a glyph slot and
         how to access specific glyph information (including metrics).</p>

      <h4>
        c. Using other charmaps
      </h4>

      <p>As said before, when a new face object is created, it will look for
      a Unicode, Latin-1, or ASCII charmap and select it.  The currently
      selected charmap is accessed via <b><tt>face->charmap</tt></b>.  This
      field is NULL when no charmap is selected, which typically happens
      when you create a new <tt>FT_Face</tt> object from a font file that
      doesn't contain an ASCII, Latin-1, or Unicode charmap (rare
      stuff).</p>

      <p>There are two ways to select a different charmap with FreeType 2.
         The easiest is when the encoding you need already has a corresponding
	 enumeration defined in <tt>&lt;freetype/freetype.h&gt;</tt>, as
	 <tt>ft_encoding_big5</tt>. In this case, you can simply call
	 <tt>FT_Select_CharMap</tt> as in:</p>
	 
      <font color="blue"><pre>
    error = FT_Select_CharMap(
                    face,                 /* target face object */
		    ft_encoding_big5 );   /* encoding..         */
      </pre></font>
      
      <p>Another way is to manually parse the list of charmaps for the
         face, this is accessible through the fields
	 <tt><b>num_charmaps</b></tt> and <tt><b>charmaps</b></tt> 
	 (notice the 's') of the face object. As you could expect,
	 the first is the number of charmaps in the face, while the
	 second is <em>a table of pointers to the charmaps</em>
	 embedded in the face.</p>
	 
      <p>Each charmap has a few visible fields used to describe it more
         precisely. Mainly, one will look at
	 <tt><b>charmap->platform_id</b></tt> and
	 <tt><b>charmap->encoding_id</b></tt> that define a pair of
	 values that can be used to describe the charmap in a rather
	 generic way.</p>

      <p>Each value pair corresponds to a given encoding. For example,
         the pair (3,1) corresponds to Unicode. Their list is
         defined in the TrueType specification but you can also use the
	 file <tt>&lt;freetype/ftnameid.h&gt;</tt> which defines several
	 helpful constants to deal with them..</p> 

      <p>To look for a specific encoding, you need to find a corresponding
         value pair in the specification, then look for it in the charmaps
	 list. Don't forget that some encoding correspond to several
	 values pair (yes it's a real mess, but blame Apple and Microsoft
	 on such stupidity..). Here's some code to do it:</p>
	 	 
      <font color="blue">
      <pre>
    FT_CharMap  found = 0;
    FT_CharMap  charmap;
    int         n;

    for ( n = 0; n &lt; face->num_charmaps; n++ )
    {
      charmap = face->charmaps[n];
      if ( charmap->platform_id == my_platform_id &&
           charmap->encoding_id == my_encoding_id )
      {
        found = charmap;
        break;
      }
    }

    if ( !found ) { ... }

    /* now, select the charmap for the face object */
    error = FT_Set_CharMap( face, found );
    if ( error ) { ... }</pre>
      </font>

     <p>Once a charmap has been selected, either through
        <tt>FT_Select_CharMap</tt> or <tt>FT_Set_CharMap</tt>,
	it is used by all subsequent calls to
	<tt>FT_Get_Char_Index()</tt>.</p>


      <h4>
        d. Glyph Transforms:
      </h4>

      <p>It is possible to specify an affine transformation to be applied
         to glyph images when they're loaded. Of course, this will only
	 work for scalable (vectorial) font formats.</p>
	 
      <p>To do that, simply call <tt>FT_Set_Transform</tt>, as in:</p>
      
     <font color="blue"><pre>
   error = FT_Set_Transform(
                    face,           /* target face object    */
		    &amp;matrix,    /* pointer to 2x2 matrix */
		    &amp;delta );   /* pointer to 2d vector  */
     </pre></font>
     
      <p>This function will set the current transform for a given face
         object. Its second parameter is a pointer to a simple
	 <tt>FT_Matrix</tt> structure that describes a 2x2 affine matrix.
	 The third parameter is a pointer to a <tt>FT_Vector</tt> structure
	 that describe a simple 2d vector.</p>
	 
      <p>Note that the matrix pointer can be set to NULL, (in which case
         the identity transform will be used). Coefficients of the matrix
	 are in 16.16 fixed float units.</p>
	 
      <p>The vector pointer can also be set to NULL (in which case a delta
         of (0,0) will be used). The vector coordinates are expressed in
	 1/64th of a pixel (also known as 26.6 fixed floats).</p>
	 
      <p><em>NOTA BENE: The transform is applied every glyph that is loaded
         through <tt>FT_Load_Glyph</tt>. Note that loading a glyph bitmap
	 with a non-trivial transform will produce an error..</em></p>
	 
      <hr>

    <h3>
      7. Accessing glyph image data
    </h3>

    <p>Glyph image data is accessible through <tt><b>face->glyph</b></tt>. 
    See the definition of the <tt>FT_GlyphSlot</tt> type for more details. 
    As stated previously, each face has a single glyph slot, where
    <em>one</em> glyph image <em>at a time</em> can be loaded.  Each time
    you call <tt>FT_Load_Glyph()</tt>, you erase the content of the glyph
    slot with a new glyph image.</p>

    <p>Note however that the glyph slot object itself doesn't change, only
    its content, which means that you can perfectly create a "shortcut" to
    access it as in</p>

    <font color="blue">
    <pre>
    {
      /* shortcut to glyph slot */
      FT_GlyphSlot  glyph = face->glyph;

      for ( n = 0; n &lt; face->num_glyphs; n++ )
      {
        ... load glyph n ...
        ... access glyph data as glyph->xxxx
      }
    }</pre>
    </font>

    <p>The <tt>glyph</tt> variable will be valid until its parent
    <tt>face</tt> is destroyed.  Here are a few important fields of the
    glyph slot:<p>

    <table cellpadding=5>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td>
          <tt><b>glyph->format</b></tt>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>Indicates the type of the loaded glyph image.  Can be either
          <tt>ft_glyph_format_bitmap</tt>, <tt>ft_glyph_format_outline</tt>,
          or other values.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign="top">

          <tt><b>glyph->metrics</b></tt>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>A simple structure used to hold the glyph image's metrics. 
          Note that <em>most distances are expressed in 1/64th of
          pixels!</em> See the API reference or the user guide for a
          description of the <tt>FT_Glyph_Metrics</tt> structure.</p>

      <tr valign="top">
        <td>
          <tt><b>glyph->bitmap</b></tt>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>If the glyph slot contains a bitmap, a simple
          <tt>FT_Bitmap</tt> that describes it.  See the API reference or
          user guide for a description of the <tt>FT_Bitmap</tt>
          structure.</p>

      </tr>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td>
          <tt><b>glyph->outline</b></tt>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>When the glyph slot contains a scalable outline, this structure

    <h3>
      8. Rendering glyph outlines into bitmaps
    </h3>

    <p>You can easily test the format of the glyph image by inspecting the
    <tt>face->glyph->format</tt> variable.  If its value is
    <tt>ft_glyph_format_bitmap</tt>, the glyph image that was loaded is a
    bitmap that can be directly blit to your own surfaces through your
    favorite graphics library (FreeType&nbsp;2 doesn't provide bitmap
    blitting routines, as you may imagine&nbsp;:-)</p>

    <p>If the format is <tt>ft_glyph_format_outline</tt> or something else,
    the library provides a means to convert such glyph images to bitmaps
    through what are called <b>rasters</b>.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, if the image is a scalable outline or something
    else, FreeType provides a function to convert the glyph image into a
    pre-existing bitmap that you will handle to it, named
    <tt>FT_Get_Glyph_Bitmap</tt>.  Here's a <em>simple</em> example code
    that renders an outline into a <b>monochrome</b> bitmap:</p>

    <font color="blue">
    <pre>
    {
      FT_GlyphSlot  glyph;

      ... load glyph ...

      glyph = face-&gt;glyph;   /* shortcut to glyph data */
      if ( glyph->format == ft_glyph_format_outline )
      {
        FT_Bitmap  bit;

        /* set-up a bitmap descriptor for our target bitmap */
        bit.rows       = bitmap_height;
        bit.width      = bitmap_width;
        bit.pitch      = bitmap_row_bytes;
        /* render into a mono bitmap */
        bit.pixel_mode = ft_pixel_mode_mono;
        bit.buffer     = bitmap_buffer;

        /* render the outline directly into the bitmap */
        error = FT_Get_Glyph_Bitmap( face, &bit );
        if ( error ) { ... }
      }
    }</pre>
    </font>

    <p>You should note that <b><em><tt>FT_Get_Glyph_Bitmap()</tt> doesn't
    create the bitmap</em></b>.  It only needs a descriptor, of type
    <tt>FT_Bitmap</tt>, and writes directly into it.</p>

    <p>Note that the FreeType scan-converter for outlines can also generate
    anti-aliased glyph bitmaps with 128 level of grays.  For now, it is
    restricted to rendering to 8-bit gray-level bitmaps, though this may
    change in the future.  Here is some code to do just that:</p>

    <font color="blue">
    <pre>
    {
      FT_GlyphSlot  glyph;

      ... load glyph ...

      glyph = face->glyph;   /* shortcut to glyph data */
      if ( glyph->format == ft_glyph_format_outline )
      {
        FT_Bitmap  bit;

        /* set-up a bitmap descriptor for our target bitmap */
        bit.rows       = bitmap_height;
        bit.width      = bitmap_width;
        bit.pitch      = bitmap_row_bytes;
        /* 8-bit gray-level bitmap */
        bit.pixel_mode = ft_pixel_mode_gray;
        /* MUST be 128 for now     */
        bit.grays      = 128;
        bit.buffer     = bitmap_buffer;

        /* clean the bitmap - IMPORTANT */
        memset( bit.buffer, 0, bit.rows*bit.pitch );

        /* render the outline directly into the bitmap */
        error = FT_Get_Glyph_Bitmap( face, &bit );
        if ( error ) { ... }
      }
    }</pre>
    </font>

    <p>You will notice that</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>As previously, <tt>FT_Get_Glyph_Bitmap()</tt> doesn't generate
        the bitmap, it simply renders to it.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The target bitmap must be cleaned before calling the function. 
        This is a limitation of our current anti-aliasing algorithm and is
        EXTREMELY important.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The anti-aliaser uses 128&nbsp;levels of grays exclusively for
        now (this will probably change in a near future).  This means that
        you <b>must</b> set <tt>bit.grays</tt> to&nbsp;128.  The generated
        image uses values from 0 (back color) to 127 (foreground color).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It is <b>not</b> possible to render directly an anti-aliased
        outline into a pre-existing gray-level bitmap, or even any
        colored-format one (like RGB16 or paletted 8-bits).  We will not
        discuss this issue in great details here, but the reason is that we
        do not want to deal with graphics composition (or alpha-blending)
        within FreeType.<p/>
